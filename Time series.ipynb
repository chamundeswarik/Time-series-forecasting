    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Econometrics is the application of statistical methods in economics (and increasingly in other social sciences too). It helps us to evaluate the relationships between different variables. For ex.\n",
    "[the relationship between average classroom size and scholastic achievement](https://economics.mit.edu/files/8273) (Angrist & Lavy, QJE, 1999)\n",
    "\n",
    "Least-squares regression is the most widely used method for modeling such relationships. It is known by many other names like \"regression\", \"OLS\", or \"linear regression\". OLS however is primarily used for [cross-sectional data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_regression) i.e. data which is associated with a single period or point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Time Series Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **data that we encounter in macroeconomics and empirical finance are often in the form of a time series** i.e. sequential observations of the same variable. Inflation index numbers or stock price observations over time are time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any kind of statistical modelling, we collect a sample of data from the phenomenon or process that we are analyzing. \n",
    "* With cross-sectional data, we randomly sample from a population to make statistical inferences. \n",
    "* For time series data, we have historical observations of say, the stock price for the last 252 days (if we are modelling the price of a stock at time t). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to think of our sample as the random realization of a ***data generating process***. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time series analysis** can be broadly defined as analyzing the historical data to understand the underlying process, its past behavior and then use it to predict the future behaviour of the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "As quantitative traders, we can use these analysis techniques in ***understanding asset price behaviour and make trading decisions based on it***.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write a time series as $$\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_T\\}$$ or $$\\{x_t\\},\\: t = 1, 2,\\dots, T$$\n"

    "There is an important concept concerned with time series known as **stationarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant part of the analysis of time series data is about the stationarity of the data. As it turns out, financial time series are mostly non-stationary. So whenever we are analyzing our data, we first need to check for its presence and *'stationarize'* it if it is not so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now look at what it means.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic process $\\{x_t\\}$ is weakly stationary or covariance stationary if\n",
    "* $\\mathrm{E}(x_t) = \\mu \\ne f(t)\\implies$ The mean of the series is constant and not a function of time.\n",
    "* $Var(x_t) = \\sigma^2 \\ne f(t)\\implies$ The variance of the series is constant and not a function of time (This is called homoskedasticity).\n",
    "* $Cov(x_t, x_{t+h}) = g(h) \\ne f(t)\\implies$ The covariance of the $t^{th}$ term and the $(t+h)^{th}$ depends only on the interval $h$ and is not a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic process $\\{x_t\\}$ is strongly stationary or strictly stationary if the joint probability distribution function of $\\{x_{t-s},\\dots,x_t,\\dots, x_{t+s}\\}$ is independent of t for all s. $\\implies$ The joint distribution of the random variables is not a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "* When a process is stationary, we can make forecasts since its statistical characteristics (such as mean, variance, covariance, etc.) are time invariant.\n",
    "* In fact, if a time series process is non-stationary, it means that its statistical characteristics vary with time. Therefore any values (such as the mean, variance, etc) that the model would predict would not be reliable.\n",
    "* In statistical modelling, a number of tests implicitly assume that the data being tested is stationary. So if we run these tests like a 'black-box' on non-stationary data, our results would be useless. \n"

    "### Plotting a White Noise process\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the building block for the basic ARMA models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we simulate and plot the white noise process $\\varepsilon_0$, $\\varepsilon_1$,$\\dots$, $\\varepsilon_T$ where each observation is drawn from a standard normal distribution. All the observations are independent and identically distributed (iid).$$\\varepsilon_t \\sim N(0, 1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, the errors are serially uncorrelated and the expected mean of these errors is equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any kind of time series models that we build should ideally result in white noise residuals (errors). Why should it be so? Because this would mean that we have successfully fit a model that captures the key dynamics of the underlying process. The only part which is unexplained by the model is random error. In other words, the difference between the values we forecast and the the values that would eventually occur would be residuals that would be indistinguishable from white noise.\n",

Here, rather than finding the correlation between two variables, say $x$ and $y$, we compute the correlation between $x_t$ and $x_{t-h}$. We plot these autocorrelations at different lags (1, 2, ...). What interests us is whether there is a pattern in the series or is it truly random. There are two key features that we look for:\n",

    "        2. Does the ACF plot decay gradually/exponentially?\n",

For ex. the partial autocorrelation calculated at lag 4, would adjust for the effects at lags 1, 2 and 3.\n",

If say $\\epsilon_t$ is unusually high, there's no reason for $\\epsilon_{t+1}$ to continue to stay high or go low. It's literally the equivalent of one coin toss having no bearing on the next. But I digress. The White Noise process does not capture the most interesting feature of time series which is persistence.
